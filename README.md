# marincovid19
During the Covid19 pandemic I wanted to make a point to a neighbor on Nextdoor that the growth was significant, so I made a plot on a [Google Sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1neJU9AKBjDqCWke0x4d7QRSA9zqoPERahumhBKgLO1k/edit?usp=sharing). Since then, I've been getting messages on Nextdoor to keep my chart updated. I decided to make a nicer looking plot properly.
